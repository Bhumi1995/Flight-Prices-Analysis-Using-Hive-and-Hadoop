Flight Prices Analysis Using Hive and Hadoop
This paper explains an analysis of flight prices purchased on Expedia between April to November 2022. The paper outlines the methods and processes used for data manipulation and further analysis. Our primary objective of the project was to provide a clear understanding of handling large data files and data cleaning processes using Hadoop File System and Hive. Besides, data interpretation and analysis were conducted using Excel and Tableau where the visualizations such as bar graphs, heat maps, 3D maps, dual-axis charts, and pie charts were created to facilitate flight prices analysis.
